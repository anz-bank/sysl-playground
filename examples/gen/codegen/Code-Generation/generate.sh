# Make sure that you use the Makefile that is used in this demonstration, (or go to https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl-template/blob/master/makefile)

# We need to edit our makefile and add the following lines at the top:
all: sysl

input = simple.sysl
app = simple
down =  # this can be a list separated by a space or left empty
out = gen

make input=simple.sysl app=simple

ls 
#gen             implementation  makefile        readme.md
#generate.sh     main.go         ordering.yaml   simple.sysl
# Now we can see that there is a "gen" folder with our generated sysl files
