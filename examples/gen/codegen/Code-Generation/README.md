## Simple REST endpoint generation in go

api/: contains all API specifications for the generated application

gen/: contains all the generated code for the service

[internal/server/server.go](./internal/server/server.go): The hand-written code that's written; Server config and such

pkg/defaultcallback: contains code that sets up the defaults for generated code. (This will no longer be necessary in future Sysl versions)

<!-- TODO: fix the link  -->
<!-- When new endpoints are added, they need to be added to the `simple.ServiceInterface` variable in [server.go](./server/server.go) -->

[main.go](./main.go): runs the actual server

run `make` to regenerate application code
First you need to edit the start of the Makefile:

```
input = your input sysl file
app = < the app you want to develop>
down = <downstreams in a list separated by spaces>
basepath = <Your current go module path>
```

so: `make input=model/simple.sysl app=Simple` for this example

run `go run main.go` to start the server
